# CYBV-480-Final-Assessment-Report
My final project for the CYBV 480 Cyber Warfare class. It details a simulated cyber operation at CyberApolis Water Company, where I identified and exploited critical vulnerabilities to regain control of the HMI system, preventing a catastrophic flood. The report includes reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and mitigation strategies.
